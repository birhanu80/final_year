# Project Setup Guide

Welcome to our project! This guide will help you set up your development environment and get started with our project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.11.0**: This project is built with Python 3.11.0. Make sure you have the correct version installed.
- **Django 5.0**: We use Django 5.0 for our project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Go to the directory**: 💿 cd to the cloned project

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with pre-installed Python versions. To create a virtual environment, use the following command, `virtualenv C:\Users\win\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311 myenv`
4. **Activate the virtual Environment**: use the command `.myenv\Scripts\activate`
5. **Install Dependencies**: With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file `pip install -r requirements.txt`
